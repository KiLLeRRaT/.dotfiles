# .dotfiles

This is my .dotfiles.  It's as multi platform as I could make it, up to a point.  You will find
dotfiles for Linux, MacOS, and Windows in here.

# Installation

## Linux
 ```bash
  curl -sL https://u.gouws.org/install-arch.sh | bash -
  curl -sL https://u.gouws.org/install-debian.sh | bash -
  curl -sL https://u.gouws.org/install-debian-server.sh | bash -
 ```

# Key Bindings

The notation for `Ctrl` is `<c-x>` and `Alt` is `<m-x>` (Alt means meta, hence the m).  The notation for `Shift` is just a capital
letter. e.g <m-H> is `alt + shift + h`.
